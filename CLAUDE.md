i want to build apps with AI Driven Development, help me to answer this question below
What I’m trying to achieve:
I want to build applications faster, smarter, and more resilient by using AI-Driven Development. The goal is to let AI act as a collaborator throughout the software lifecycle — from requirements analysis and architecture design, to code generation, testing, documentation, and continuous improvement.

By doing this, I aim to:

Accelerate development – reduce manual and repetitive tasks so teams can focus on solving core business problems.

Increase quality – leverage AI to detect design flaws, suggest best practices, and generate reliable tests early.

Enable adaptive systems – use AI to continuously analyze user needs, system behavior, and performance, then recommend improvements.

Create knowledge-driven projects – where project knowledge (requirements, PRDs, domain models, tasks) is stored in structured and retrievable formats, making development more transparent and maintainable.

Ultimately, the achievement is to build a self-improving development ecosystem where human creativity and AI intelligence combine to deliver software that adapts quickly to change.
